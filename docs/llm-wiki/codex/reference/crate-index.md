> `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` defines the Rust workspace: the current `members` array contains 123 workspace member paths, closes at line 126, uses Cargo resolver `"2"`, and centralizes workspace package version, edition, license, and dependency declarations.[E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:1][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:2][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:3][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:125][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:126][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:127][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:129][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:130][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:135][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:136][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:138]

## 能回答的问题

- 当前 `codex-rs` workspace 中有哪些 member paths?
- 某个 workspace member 在 `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` 的哪一行登记?
- workspace member count 当前是多少?
- workspace resolver、package version、edition、license 在哪里定义?
- `[workspace.dependencies]` 从哪里开始?

## Workspace 元数据

| Symbol | 当前值 | 说明 | 定义处 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[workspace].members` | 123 entries | `members` starts at line 2, member entries cover line 3 through line 125, and the array closes at line 126. | [E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:1][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:2][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:3][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:125][E: codex-rs/Cargo.toml:126] |
